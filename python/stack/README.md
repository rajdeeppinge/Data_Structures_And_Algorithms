# Stack in Python

The stack data structure follows Last In First Out (LIFO) or alternatively, First In Last Out (FILO) method to store elements

If typically provides the following functions:
- push(element): Insert and element on the top of the stack - Time Complexity: O(1)
- peek() - Returns a reference/value of the topmost element of the stack without removing it - Time Complexity: O(1)
- pop() - Removes and returns the element at the top of the stack - Time Complexity: O(1)
- is_empty()/empty() - Returns whether the stack is empty - Time Complexity: O(1)
- size() - Returns the size of the stack - Time Complexity: O(1)
    
This module implements the stack using the following method(s):
- Using built-in `list` data structure

## Using built-in `list` data structure
- In Python, the built-in `list` data structure can be used to implement stacks
- list.append() can be used to append/add to the stack
- pop() can be used to get an element at the top of the stack as per LIFO principle
