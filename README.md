# Data_Structures_And_Algorithms_Labs
This repository contains Labs for the course Data Structures and Algorithms. 
The labs focus on many standard data structures starting from the basics of stacks and queues to Binary Trees, BSTs, AVL trees, B-Trees, Graphs and Hash Tables.
Many of the standard algorithms like searching and sorting, tree and graph based algorithms have also been covered.
All the coding has been done in Java.
